## 1. Prerequisites Checklist

You need three things installed before you start:

| Prerequisite | Required Version | Download Link |
|---|---|---|
| **Python** | 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13 | [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| **pip** | Any (comes with Python) | Included with Python |
| **Git** | Any | [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |

> **Warning**: Do **NOT** install Python 3.14 or any version marked "pre-release" or "alpha/beta". Many dependencies (like NumPy and pandas) will fail to install on pre-release Python. Stick to **3.10, 3.11, 3.12, or 3.13**.

### Already installed? Verify with these commands

Open a terminal (Mac: **Terminal** app; Windows: **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell**) and run:

**Check Python:**
```
python --version
```
Expected output (any of these is fine):
```
Python 3.12.8
```

**Check pip:**
```
pip --version
```
Expected output:
```
pip 24.3.1 from /usr/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pip (python 3.12)
```

**Check Git:**
```
git --version
```
Expected output:
```
git version 2.43.0
```

If any of these commands show an error like `'python' is not recognized` or `command not found`, follow the installation steps in the next section.

> **Windows note**: If `python` doesn't work, try `py` instead. Windows sometimes uses `py` as the Python command.

---

## 2. Installing Prerequisites

### Windows

#### Install Python

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the latest **stable** release (look for 3.12.x or 3.13.x — do NOT pick anything labeled "pre-release")
3. Run the installer
4. **IMPORTANT**: On the very first screen of the installer, check the box that says **"Add python.exe to PATH"** — this is easy to miss and causes most install problems

   ![Add to PATH checkbox](https://docs.python.org/3/_images/win_installer.png)

5. Click "Install Now"
6. When it finishes, click "Disable path length limit" if prompted, then close the installer

#### Install Git

1. Go to [git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)
2. Download the installer
3. Run it and click "Next" through all the screens (the defaults are fine)
4. Click "Install", then "Finish"

#### Verify the installations

**Close and reopen** your Command Prompt or PowerShell (this is important — the new PATH settings only take effect in new windows), then run:

```
python --version
pip --version
git --version
```

All three commands should print version numbers, not errors. If `python` doesn't work, try `py --version` instead.

---

### Mac

#### Install Python

**Option A: Using Homebrew (recommended if you have Homebrew)**

If you already have Homebrew installed, run:
```bash
brew install python@3.12
```

**Option B: Using the installer from python.org**

1. Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download the macOS installer for the latest stable 3.12.x or 3.13.x
3. Open the `.pkg` file and follow the prompts
4. When the install finishes, it may open a Finder window — you can close it

> **Tip**: On Mac, you may need to use `python3` and `pip3` instead of `python` and `pip`. This guide will use `python` for simplicity, but substitute `python3`/`pip3` if needed.

#### Install Git

Git is usually already installed on Mac. To check, run:
```bash
git --version
```

If you see a version number, you're all set. If you get a prompt to install "command line developer tools", click **Install** and wait for it to finish. You can also install manually:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### Verify the installations

Open a **new** Terminal window and run:
```bash
python3 --version
pip3 --version
git --version
```

All three should print version numbers.

---

## 3. Install the Tool

Pick **one** of these two methods:

### Method A: One-command install (recommended)

This installs the tool and all its dependencies in one step:

**Mac:**
```bash
pip3 install git+https://github.com/BioTechNerd-Apache/pharma-job-search.git
```

**Windows:**
```
pip install git+https://github.com/BioTechNerd-Apache/pharma-job-search.git
```

This creates a `pharma-job-search` command you can run from anywhere.

### Method B: Clone and install

If you want a local copy of the code (useful if you plan to customize):

**Mac:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BioTechNerd-Apache/pharma-job-search.git
cd pharma-job-search
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

**Windows:**
```
git clone https://github.com/BioTechNerd-Apache/pharma-job-search.git
cd pharma-job-search
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verify the install

**If you used Method A:**
```
pharma-job-search --help
```

**If you used Method B:**
```
python job_search.py --help
```

You should see a help message listing available commands. If you see an error, check the [Troubleshooting](#9-troubleshooting) section.

---

## 4. Configure the Tool

Everything is configured through the **dashboard's Setup tab** — no need to edit config files by hand.

> **Note**: `config.yaml` is auto-created the first time you launch the dashboard. You do **not** need to copy it manually.

### Launch the dashboard

**If you used Method A (pip install):**
```
pharma-job-search --web
```

**If you used Method B (clone):**
```
python job_search.py --web
```

Your browser will open to `http://localhost:8501`. Click the **Setup / Profile** tab at the top.

### Walk through the Setup tab

1. **Choose an AI provider** — Pick Anthropic, OpenAI, or Ollama (free) and enter your API key. Ollama requires no key — just install it from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) and run `ollama pull llama3.1:8b` in your terminal first.
2. **Upload your resume** — Click "Upload Resume" and select your PDF, DOCX, or TXT file, then click **Run Setup Wizard**. The AI reads your resume and generates search terms, filters, evaluator patterns, and a resume profile — all automatically.
3. **Review and edit** — After the wizard runs, you can tweak search terms, filters, API keys, and patterns in the same Setup tab. All changes auto-save to config files.

That's it — everything is configured. You can close the Setup tab and start searching.

### AI provider options

| Provider | Cost | Setup |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Ollama (free)** | Free | Install from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download), then run `ollama pull llama3.1:8b` |
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | Paid | Get key at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys) |
| **OpenAI (GPT)** | Paid | Get key at [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) |

### Optional job board API keys

None of these are required — Indeed and LinkedIn work without any keys. You can add these in the Setup tab under "Job Board API Keys" if you want more sources.

| API Key | What it adds | Where to get it |
|---|---|---|
| USAJobs | Federal job listings | [developer.usajobs.gov](https://developer.usajobs.gov/) |
| Adzuna | Adzuna job listings | [developer.adzuna.com](https://developer.adzuna.com/) |
| Jooble | Jooble job listings | [jooble.org/api/about](https://jooble.org/api/about) |

### Terminal alternative (optional)

If you prefer to set up entirely from the terminal, you can run the setup wizard as a CLI command. You don't need to edit any files by hand — the wizard is interactive and prompts you for everything.

**What you need before running the wizard:**
- Your resume file (PDF, DOCX, or TXT) saved somewhere on your computer
- **One** of these AI providers ready:
  - **Ollama** (free) — install from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download), then run `ollama pull llama3.1:8b`
  - **Anthropic** — have your API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
  - **OpenAI** — have your API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

**Run the wizard:**

```
python job_search.py --setup resume.pdf
```

Replace `resume.pdf` with the actual path to your resume file.

**What happens step by step:**

1. **API keys** — The wizard prompts you for each API key. Type or paste the key and press Enter, or just press Enter to skip optional ones:
   ```
   Enter Anthropic API key (or press Enter to skip): sk-ant-...
   Enter USAJobs API key (or press Enter to skip): [Enter]
   Enter Adzuna App ID (or press Enter to skip): [Enter]
   Enter Jooble API key (or press Enter to skip): [Enter]
   ```
   > If you're using Ollama, you don't need any API key — just make sure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`).

2. **Resume profile** — The AI reads your resume and generates a structured profile (career history, skills, target domains). You'll see a preview and be asked:
   ```
   Accept this resume profile? [Y/n]:
   ```
   Type `Y` (or just press Enter) to accept, or `n` to skip.

3. **Search configuration** — The AI generates search terms, priority terms, synonyms, and include/exclude filters based on your resume. You'll see them listed and be asked to confirm.

4. **Evaluator patterns** — The AI generates regex patterns for the pre-filter (what to skip, rescue, and boost). Confirm again.

5. **Save** — The wizard shows which files it will create and asks for final confirmation:
   ```
   Files to write:
     - config.yaml
     - data/resume_profile.json
     - data/evaluator_patterns.yaml
   Proceed with saving? [Y/n]:
   ```

That's it. The wizard creates `config.yaml` and all data files — you don't need to manually copy or edit anything. You can always fine-tune the generated config later in the dashboard's Setup tab.

> **Note**: You do **not** need to copy `config.yaml` first. The wizard creates it automatically. If one already exists, your existing settings are preserved and only new values are added.

---

## 5. Using Free AI — No API Key Required (Ollama)

The AI features (setup wizard + job scoring) normally require a paid API key from Anthropic or OpenAI. **Ollama is a free alternative** that runs an AI model directly on your own computer — no account, no credit card, no monthly bill, and no data ever leaves your machine.

This section walks you through choosing the right model for your computer, installing Ollama, and connecting it to this tool.

---

### Step 1 — Check how much RAM your computer has

The model you can run depends on how much memory (RAM) your computer has. Here is how to check:

**On Mac:**
1. Click the **Apple menu** () in the top-left corner of your screen
2. Click **About This Mac**
3. Look for the line that says **Memory** — for example, "16 GB"

**On Windows:**
1. Press the **Windows key**, type **"About your PC"**, and press Enter
2. Look for **Installed RAM** — for example, "16.0 GB"

Write down your RAM amount before moving to the next step.

---

### Step 2 — Pick a model for your computer

Use this table to choose a model. Pick the **highest row your RAM meets**:

| Your RAM | Recommended model | What to expect |
|---|---|---|
| **4 GB or less** | `phi3:mini` | Works, but slow. Basic job scoring only. |
| **8 GB** | `llama3.1:8b` | Good quality. Recommended starting point. |
| **16 GB** | `gemma3:12b` | Better reasoning. Noticeably more accurate scoring. |
| **32 GB or more** | `gemma3:12b` | Same model, but runs faster with headroom to spare. |

> **Not sure which to pick?** Start with `llama3.1:8b`. It works well on most modern laptops and is the model referenced throughout this guide.

> **Apple Silicon Mac (M1, M2, M3, M4 chip)?** All models above run significantly faster on Apple Silicon than on older Intel Macs or Windows laptops with the same RAM. If you have an M-series Mac with 8 GB, `gemma3:12b` is worth trying.

> **How to check your Mac chip**: Apple menu → About This Mac → look for "Apple M1" / "M2" / etc. under the chip or processor line. If it says "Intel", you have an Intel Mac.

---

### Step 3 — Install Ollama

Ollama is installed like any normal application — no terminal required for this step.

**Mac:**
1. Go to [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
2. Click the **Download for macOS** button
3. Open the downloaded file (`Ollama-darwin.zip`) — it will extract to an app called **Ollama**
4. Drag **Ollama** into your **Applications** folder
5. Open **Ollama** from your Applications folder (or Launchpad)
6. A small llama icon will appear in your menu bar at the top of the screen — this means Ollama is running

**Windows:**
1. Go to [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)
2. Click the **Download for Windows** button
3. Run the downloaded installer (`OllamaSetup.exe`)
4. Click through the installer (the defaults are fine)
5. Ollama will start automatically. A small llama icon will appear in the system tray (bottom-right corner of your screen near the clock)

> **Ollama must be running** any time you use the AI features of this tool. If you restart your computer, open Ollama again from your Applications folder (Mac) or Start menu (Windows) before running a search.

---

### Step 4 — Download your chosen model

This is the only step that requires the terminal. You only need to do it **once**.

**Open a terminal:**
- **Mac**: Press **Cmd + Space**, type **Terminal**, and press Enter
- **Windows**: Press the **Windows key**, type **Command Prompt**, and press Enter

**Type the command for your chosen model** and press Enter:

| Model | Command to type |
|---|---|
| `phi3:mini` (4 GB RAM) | `ollama pull phi3:mini` |
| `llama3.1:8b` (8 GB RAM) | `ollama pull llama3.1:8b` |
| `gemma3:12b` (16 GB RAM) | `ollama pull gemma3:12b` |

Example output — you will see a progress bar while the model downloads:

```
pulling manifest
pulling 970aa74c0a90... 100% ████████████ 4.7 GB
verifying sha256 digest
writing manifest
success
```

The download is large (4–8 GB depending on the model). It may take several minutes on a slower connection. You only need to download it once — after that it is stored on your computer.

> **Terminal tip for beginners**: In the terminal, you type a command and press **Enter** to run it. You cannot click — just type exactly what is shown and press Enter. When it is done, you will see a new line with a blinking cursor.

---

### Step 5 — Connect Ollama to this tool

You can connect Ollama through the dashboard (easiest) or through the setup wizard.

#### Option A: Through the dashboard (recommended)

1. Launch the dashboard:

   **If you used Method A (pip install):**
   ```
   pharma-job-search --web
   ```

   **If you used Method B (clone):**
   ```
   python job_search.py --web
   ```

2. Your browser opens to `http://localhost:8501`. Click the **Setup / Profile** tab at the top.
3. Under **AI Provider**, click the dropdown and select **Ollama**.
4. In the **Model** field, type the model name you downloaded — for example: `llama3.1:8b`
5. Leave the **Ollama URL** field as-is (`http://localhost:11434`) — this is the default and does not need to change.
6. Click **Save Settings**.

That's it. The tool will now use your local Ollama model instead of a paid API.

#### Option B: Through the terminal wizard

If you prefer the terminal setup wizard, choose **Ollama** when it asks for an AI provider and enter your model name when prompted.

---

### Verifying it works

To confirm Ollama is connected and working, go to the **Setup / Profile** tab in the dashboard and click **Test Connection**. You should see a green confirmation message. If you see a red error, check the troubleshooting steps below.

---

### Ollama troubleshooting

**"Connection refused" or "Cannot connect to Ollama"**

Ollama is not running. Open the Ollama app from your Applications folder (Mac) or Start menu (Windows) and wait for the llama icon to appear in the menu bar / system tray. Then try again.

**The model runs very slowly**

This is normal if you are running a large model on a computer with limited RAM. Try a smaller model:
- Switch from `gemma3:12b` to `llama3.1:8b`
- Switch from `llama3.1:8b` to `phi3:mini`

Download the smaller model first (`ollama pull phi3:mini`), then update the model name in the dashboard Setup tab.

**"model not found" error**

You need to download the model first. Open a terminal and run `ollama pull llama3.1:8b` (or whichever model you chose). Then try again.

**Mac: Ollama icon is not in the menu bar**

Ollama may not have started. Open your Applications folder and double-click **Ollama** to launch it.

**Windows: Ollama icon is not in the system tray**

Click the **^** arrow in the bottom-right corner of your screen to show hidden tray icons. If you still don't see it, search for **Ollama** in the Start menu and open it.

---

> **Note**: You can use different AI providers for different tasks. For example, you could use Ollama (free) for daily bulk job scoring and Anthropic (paid) only for the one-time setup wizard that reads your resume. Configure each separately in the dashboard Setup tab under **Wizard AI Provider** and **Evaluation AI Provider**.

---

## 6. Run Your First Search

### From the dashboard (recommended)

If you still have the dashboard open from the previous step, click **Run New Search** in the left sidebar. This scrapes all configured job boards and displays the results in the Job Listings tab.

If you closed the dashboard, launch it again:

**If you used Method A:**
```
pharma-job-search --web
```

**If you used Method B:**
```
python job_search.py --web
```

### From the terminal (alternative)

```
python job_search.py --days 1
```

This searches for jobs posted in the last 24 hours. Results are saved to `data/pharma_jobs.csv` and `data/pharma_jobs.xlsx`. Open the dashboard afterwards to browse them.

### Evaluate jobs with AI (optional)

From the terminal:
```
python job_search.py --evaluate
```

This searches for jobs and then scores them against your resume using AI. Requires an AI provider to be configured (Anthropic, OpenAI, or Ollama).

---

## 7. Create a Desktop Shortcut (Optional)

Create a shortcut on your Desktop that launches the dashboard with one click:

**If you used Method A (pip install):**
```
pharma-job-search --create-shortcut
```

**If you used Method B (clone):**
```
python job_search.py --create-shortcut
```

This creates:
- **Mac**: `~/Desktop/Pharma Job Search.command` (double-click to launch)
- **Windows**: `~/Desktop/Pharma Job Search.bat` (double-click to launch)

---

## 8. Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

### GUI path (recommended) — install, launch, done

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install python@3.12                    # 1. Install Python (skip if already installed)
pip3 install git+https://github.com/BioTechNerd-Apache/pharma-job-search.git  # 2. Install the tool

pharma-job-search --setup resume.pdf
pharma-job-search --web
```

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

### "pip is not recognized" or "pip: command not found"

**Cause**: pip is not on your system PATH.

**Fix**: Use `python -m pip` instead of `pip`:
```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/BioTechNerd-Apache/pharma-job-search.git
```

On Mac, use `python3 -m pip` instead of `pip3`.

If that also fails, reinstall Python and make sure to check **"Add python.exe to PATH"** (Windows) during installation.

---

### "git is not recognized" or "git: command not found"

**Cause**: Git is not installed or not on your PATH.

**Fix**:
- **Windows**: Download and install Git from [git-scm.com/downloads/win](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win), then **close and reopen** your Command Prompt
- **Mac**: Run `xcode-select --install` to install the command line tools

---

### "python is not recognized" (Windows)

**Cause**: Python is not on your PATH.

**Fixes** (try in order):
1. Try `py` instead of `python` (e.g., `py job_search.py --web`)
2. Try `py -m pip` instead of `pip`
3. Reinstall Python — make sure to check the **"Add python.exe to PATH"** checkbox on the first screen of the installer
4. After reinstalling, **close and reopen** Command Prompt

---

### NumPy, pandas, or other packages fail to install with compile errors

**Cause**: You likely have Python 3.14 (pre-release) installed. Pre-release Python versions don't have pre-built packages (called "wheels") for most libraries, so pip tries to compile them from source — which usually fails.

**Fix**:
1. Uninstall Python 3.14
2. Install Python **3.12** or **3.13** (the latest stable versions) from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Make sure to check **"Add python.exe to PATH"** during installation
4. Close and reopen your terminal
5. Verify: `python --version` should show 3.12.x or 3.13.x
6. Try the install again

---

### "python3: command not found" (Mac)

**Cause**: Python 3 isn't installed or Homebrew isn't linked.

**Fix**:
```bash
brew install python@3.12
```

Or download the installer from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

---

### PowerShell says "running scripts is disabled on this system"

**Cause**: PowerShell's execution policy blocks scripts.

**Fix**: Use **Command Prompt** instead of PowerShell. Search for "cmd" in the Start menu and open "Command Prompt". All the commands in this guide work in Command Prompt.

Alternatively, open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

---

### "Permission denied" or "ERROR: Could not install packages" (Mac)

**Cause**: You don't have permission to install to the system Python directory.

**Fixes** (try in order):
1. Add `--user` to install to your user directory:
   ```bash
   pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/BioTechNerd-Apache/pharma-job-search.git
   ```
2. Or use a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv ~/pharma-env
   source ~/pharma-env/bin/activate
   pip install git+https://github.com/BioTechNerd-Apache/pharma-job-search.git
   ```
   You'll need to run `source ~/pharma-env/bin/activate` each time you open a new terminal before using the tool.

---

### "No module named 'streamlit'" or similar import errors

**Cause**: Dependencies didn't install correctly.

**Fix**: Reinstall the requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or if you used Method A:
```
pip install --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/BioTechNerd-Apache/pharma-job-search.git
```

---

### The dashboard doesn't open in my browser

**Cause**: The browser didn't launch automatically.

**Fix**: After running `python job_search.py --web`, manually open your browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:8501
```
